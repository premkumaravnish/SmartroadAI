🎯 Project Objective

Road potholes are a major cause of:

Road accidents

Vehicle damage

Traffic disruption

Our goal is to build an automated AI-based solution that:

Detects potholes in real-time

Works on CCTV / dashcam footage

Can be integrated with smart city systems

Helps authorities take faster action

🧠 Technologies Used

🐍 Python

🔥 PyTorch

🎯 YOLO (You Only Look Once)

📷 OpenCV (cv2)

📊 NumPy

📦 TorchVision

⚙️ How It Works

Collect and prepare pothole dataset

Train YOLO model on annotated images

Detect potholes in:

Images

Recorded videos

Live camera feed

Draw bounding boxes around detected potholes

Output detection confidence score
Future Improvements

📍 GPS tagging of potholes

☁️ Cloud integration

📱 Mobile app integration

🛰️ Smart city dashboard

Real-time alert system for authorities
